            These Terms, including any documents referenced herein, represent
            the entire understanding between you and One Communn regarding your
            relationship with One Communn and your use of the Site and the
            Services. These Terms shall not be construed against any party by
            reason of their preparation, but shall be resolved by applying the
            most reasonable interpretation under the circumstances, giving full
            consideration to the intentions of the parties at the time of
            contracting. These Terms supersede all previous written or oral
            agreements between you and One Communn with respect to such subject
            matter. Where One Communn has provided you with a translation of an
            English version of these Terms, you agree that the translation is
            provided for your convenience only and that the English language
            version of the Terms will govern your relationship with One Communn.
            If there is any contradiction between what the English language
            version of the Terms say and what a translation says, the English
            language version shall take precedence. Notwithstanding any
            provisions of these Terms, One Communn has available all remedies at
            law or equity to enforce these Terms.
